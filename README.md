GCcontent.sh simply calculates the GC content of a multifasta file. 
MKTtest is a pipeline to do the Mcdonal Kreitman test assuming you have a VCF file, a genome/transcriptome assembly in fasta format, and a gff or gtf file with the annotation of the open reading frames and coding sequence regions. 
TajimaD.r is an r function to calculate Tajima's D based on the the nucleotide diversity, pi, the number of segregating sites, S, and the number of sequences. 
VCF2FASTA and VCF2indFASTA convert vcf files and a reference fasta into individual sequences, either a single sequence per individual using the IUPAC coding for heterozygote ambiguities or printing both haplotypes for diploid individuals.
